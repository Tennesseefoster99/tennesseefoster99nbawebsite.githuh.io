               Kyrie Irving is a 6'2 guard 27 years old he is the best dribbler right now probably one of the best of all time. Before
                Kyrie got hurt he was averaging 27.4 PPG with 6.4 APG. Kyrie on some nights will drop 40 points even 50 points,
                but he lacks on defence. Also is a bad team he ball hogs a lot and makes his team mates look bad too. it was difficult
                to put either Damian Lillard or Kyrie Irving in the top ten.

            Russell Westbrook is 31 years old he is 6'3 and this man was basically a walking triple Double. Russell Westbrook
            averages 27.4 PPG 8.0 RPG and 7.1 APG he is an excellent finisher at the rim for his height but lacks in shooting.
            some nights his jumpshot is wet others can't go in at all. Also lacks to lead his team in the playoffs because their is
            some nights where, he doesn't care about winning but cares for getting a triple double. If he makes his jumpshot more constantly
            and change his ways, of playing basketball he can definitely be in the top 5.

        Luka Doncic is putting up 29.0 PPG 9.5 RPG and 8.8 APG he is only 21 years old playing guard at 6'7. Even though he hasn't
        been in the league for long, putting up those numbers are still impressive especially at that age. luka Doncic is not that good
        of a shooter but still can shoot from range Nba players still respect his shots, he is good at finishing at the rim
        it is hard to block him since he is tall. Luka Doncic still need to work on his shot, but if the game is on the line
        he is the man that you will goto.

            Anthony Davis is 27 years old 6'11 and he been improving every year he is averaging 26.4 PPG 9.4 RPG and 3.2 APG.
            if keeps doing this for a couple more years he will be in the Hall Of Fame, also he is one of the best Big men
            in the Nba. Even if he doesn't have much experience in the Nba playoffs he is playing with Lebron James, helping the
            Los Angeles Lakers. Davis have been taken care of his body so hopefully he will play in the playoffs without getting hurt.

            James Harden is 30 years old putting up 34.3 PPG 6.4 RPG and 7.5 APG at 6'4. James Harden may be the best offensive
            player of all time, he finds new ways how to get open and be creative to get to the basket. James Harden isn't known
            for defense at all only offence. James Harden has one of the Hardest step-back to guard his step-back creates
            so much space to shoot, when he does it there is a good chance that he will get foul especially at the 3 pointer. The
            thinking ability of scoring 40, 50 or even 60 points with a triple double is ridiculous. if he could only play defense
            he could easily be top 3.

           Before Stephen curry broke his hand not able to play for the rest of the season. Curry had 20.8 PPG
            5.2 RPG and 6.6 APG, Curry is 32 years old and definitely one of the best shooters of all time Curry can shoot from anywhere on the court
            constantly and can shoot very far too. Curry shot is fast and very hard to guard, you must at all times can't give room
            Curry to shoot, if you give him any kind of openness he will make it all day. He will shoot it in your face and make it over you as well.
            Curry have lots of sets plays with his team to get open since Nba players gives him Barely any room to dribble.
